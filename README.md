Scale Maker

 I'm Luke. I have been learning Java for the last 6 weeks. I have a BA in Music so naturally I wanted to create an application that can print out any type of scale I wanted. 
 
 Scale Maker uses 
 String arrays that respresent music keys. (String[] cMajor="C,D,E,F,G,A,B")
 two Methods, lowerNote() & raiseNote() alter the String elements within the music keys.
 other Methods majorScale(), minorScale(), lydianScale()... call lowerNote() and raiseNote() as needed to construct the desired scale.
 
 User types into console
 Make.majorScale(Key.c[]);
 Make.lydianScale(key.d[]);
 Console prints
 C,D,E,F,G,A,B
 D,E,F#,G#,A,B,C#
